THREAD LIFECYCLE
•Thread - thread is the smallest unit of CPU execution. It is a lightweight process
◦ Process = full program(which consumes memory and resources)
Thread = path of execution within a process
*Java Context = every java app starts with one thread
main thread


>> NEW > RUNNABLE > [RUNNING <> BLOCKED/WAITING] > TERMINATED


1. NEW STATE = thread object created, start() not called (Trigger : Thread t = new Thread())


2. RUNNABLE STATE =ready to run, waiting for CPU(Trigger : t.start ())


3. RUNNING STATE = executing the run() method (Trigger : automatically JVM schedules it)
4. BLOCKED STATE = waiting for monitor lock (Trigger :synchronized block/sethod)
5. WAITING STATE = Indefinitely walting (Trigger : wait(), join(),)
6. TIMED_WAITING STATE = walting with timeout (Trigger : sleep(1000), wait(1000),join(1000))
7.TERMINATED STATE = run()finished and code execution completed
